      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ul>
        <ol>
          <span>Beat the eggs</span
          >: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they
          are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier
          texture.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <span>Heat the pan</span
          >: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <span>Cook the omelette</span
          >: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the
          pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <span>Add fillings (optional)</span
          >: When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny
          in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the
          omelette.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <span>Fold and serve</span
          >: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold
          it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto
          a plate.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <span>Enjoy</span
          >: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
